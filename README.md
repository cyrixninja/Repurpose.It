# What it does ?
It is a web application that utilizes AI technologies, including OpenAI and Azure Vision API, to analyze uploaded images of unused items. It provides personalized suggestions on how to repurpose or reuse these items creatively. Additionally, the platform features a marketplace where users can showcase and sell their repurposed goods, fostering a circular economy.

# How we built it? 
It involved several key technologies and steps:

- Frontend Development: We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface (UI) and design elements of the web application. This includes the layout, navigation menus, and interactive features for users to upload images and navigate through the platform.

- Backend Development: The backend of Repupose.It is powered by Flask, a Python web framework. Flask handles the server-side logic, routing, and interactions with the database and AI services. We used MongoDB as our database to store user data, uploaded images, and marketplace listings.

- AI Integration: Repupose.It leverages AI technologies from OpenAI and Azure Vision API. OpenAI's algorithms analyze uploaded images to identify the items and provide personalized suggestions for repurposing or reusing them creatively. Azure Vision API enhances image recognition capabilities, aiding in the AI-powered suggestions.

- Marketplace Functionality: We implemented features to allow users to add their repurposed goods to the marketplace. This involved creating forms for users to input product details, images, pricing, and other relevant information. MongoDB was utilized to store and manage marketplace listings.
